## üöß Simplifications for MVP

### 1. No AVAX Tipping
**Original Spec:** Users can tip AVAX to post creators

**MVP:** Only TASTE token rewards (no AVAX tipping)

**Reason:** Simplifies MVP, reduces gas costs, faster to implement

**Future:** Add optional AVAX tipping button in Phase 2

---

### 2. No Content Moderation
**Limitation:** No on-chain or off-chain content moderation

**MVP Approach:** Assume all posts are legitimate user content

**Risk:** Potential for spam or inappropriate content

**Future Solutions:**
- Community reporting system
- Stake-based posting (require TASTE deposit)
- DAO-based content moderation
- AI content filtering before minting

---

### 3. Simplified Like Prevention
**Current:** Each address can only like a post once (tracked on-chain)

**Limitation:** No prevention of:
- Multiple wallets from same user
- Bot-generated likes

**Future Solutions:**
- Require minimum TASTE balance to like
- Reputation system
- Rate limiting via smart contract
- Cooldown periods between likes

---

### 4. Manual Firebase Sync
**MVP Approach:** Frontend updates Firebase directly after transactions

**Limitation:**
- Race conditions possible
- No automatic sync if user closes browser
- Inconsistency if Firebase fails

**Production Solution:**
- Backend service listening to blockchain events
- Automatic sync via Cloud Functions
- Retry logic for failed syncs
- Event replay capability

---

### 5. No NFT Marketplace
**MVP:** NFTs are minted but not tradeable in-app

**Limitation:** Users cannot buy/sell post NFTs

**Future:**
- Marketplace for trading post NFTs
- Royalties for original creators
- TASTE as marketplace currency

---

### 6. No Recipe Structured Data
**MVP:** Recipes are free-form text in caption

**Limitation:** No structured data for ingredients, steps, cooking time, etc.

**Future:**
- Structured recipe schema
- Searchable by ingredients
- Difficulty ratings
- Nutritional information

---

### 7. No Location Verification
**Taste-to-Earn Spec:** User adds location text

**MVP:** Location is free text, not verified

**Limitation:** Users can claim any location

**Future:**
- GPS verification
- Restaurant partnerships with QR codes
- Check-in system with proof

---

### 8. Basic Token Distribution
**MVP:** All tokens minted from treasury as users earn

**Limitation:** No vesting, no ICO, no tokenomics modeling

**Future:**
- Vesting schedule for team/advisors
- Liquidity pools on DEXs
- Token burns for deflation
- Staking mechanisms

---

### 9. No Private/Draft Posts
**MVP:** All posts are public immediately

**Limitation:** Cannot save drafts or make private posts

**Future:**
- Draft system
- Private posts visible only to followers
- Scheduled posting

---

### 10. No Mobile App
**MVP:** Web-only responsive design

**Limitation:** Not optimized for mobile camera workflow

**Future:**
- React Native mobile app
- Direct camera integration
- Push notifications
- Offline drafting

---

## üîê Security Considerations

### Audited:
- ‚úÖ OpenZeppelin contracts (industry standard)
- ‚úÖ Basic access control patterns

### Not Audited:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Custom TasteRewarder logic
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Frontend contract interactions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è IPFS upload security

**Recommendation:**
- Get professional audit before mainnet
- Bug bounty program
- Gradual rollout with limits

---

## ‚ö° Performance Considerations

### Blockchain:
- **Gas costs:** ~0.01-0.03 AVAX per post on Fuji
- **Confirmation time:** ~2 seconds on Avalanche
- **Scalability:** Avalanche can handle high throughput

### IPFS:
- **Upload speed:** 2-5 seconds per image
- **Availability:** Pinata ensures files stay pinned
- **Gateway speed:** Can be slow, consider CDN in future

### Firebase:
- **Query speed:** <100ms for most queries
- **Scalability:** Good for MVP, may need indexing optimization at scale
- **Cost:** Free tier sufficient for MVP

---

## üõ£Ô∏è Known Limitations

### 1. Token ID Tracking
**Issue:** Frontend uses placeholder tokenId (0) when saving to Firebase

**Why:** Token ID only available after transaction confirmation

**Solution:** Use event listener to update tokenId after mint

---

### 2. Balance Refresh
**Issue:** TASTE balance doesn't auto-update after earning

**Why:** wagmi caches contract reads

**Solution:** Manual refresh button (included), or polling

---

### 3. Image Size
**Issue:** Large images (>10MB) rejected

**Why:** Pinata limits, UX considerations

**Solution:** Client-side compression (future enhancement)

---

### 4. Concurrent Likes
**Issue:** If many users like at same time, likeCount may be slightly off in Firebase

**Why:** Race condition in increment operation

**Solution:** Use Firestore FieldValue.increment() (planned)

---

### 5. No Search
**Issue:** Cannot search posts by caption, creator, or mode

**Why:** Basic Firebase queries only

**Solution:** Add Algolia or Elasticsearch for full-text search

---

### 6. Limited NFT Metadata
**Issue:** Cannot update NFT metadata after minting

**Why:** Standard ERC-721 with fixed tokenURI

**Solution:** Use dynamic metadata endpoints (future)

---

## üåê Browser Compatibility

### Tested:
- ‚úÖ Chrome/Brave (Desktop & Mobile)
- ‚úÖ Firefox (Desktop)
- ‚úÖ Safari (Desktop)

### Known Issues:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Safari may have Web3 wallet issues (use MetaMask mobile)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Old browsers without Web3 support won't work

---

## üì± Wallet Compatibility

### Supported:
- ‚úÖ Core Wallet
- ‚úÖ MetaMask (with Avalanche network added)
- ‚úÖ Any WalletConnect-compatible wallet

### Not Tested:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Coinbase Wallet

---

## üîÑ Data Consistency

### Eventual Consistency:
- Firebase updates are async
- Blockchain confirmations take ~2 seconds
- Feed may show slight delays

### Source of Truth:
- **Blockchain:** NFT ownership, token balances, like status
- **Firebase:** Display data for performance (should sync with blockchain)

**Conflict Resolution:** Blockchain data always wins in disputes

---

## üí∞ Economic Considerations

### MVP Token Economics:
- **Inflation:** Unlimited minting (by design for MVP)
- **No token sink:** No burning or staking
- **Value:** Speculative only in MVP

### Risks:
- Token value dilution with unlimited minting
- No incentive to hold tokens
- Potential for farming/gaming

### Future Solutions:
- Token burning on certain actions
- Staking for boosted rewards
- Utility beyond rewards (governance, premium features)
- Supply caps or emission schedules

---

## üéØ Target Audience (MVP)

**Primary:**
- Crypto-native users comfortable with wallets
- Food enthusiasts in Web3 communities
- Early adopters and testers

**Not Target (Yet):**
- Mainstream non-crypto users (onboarding too complex)
- Professional chefs/restaurants (no verification)
- Food critics (no structured reviews)

---

## üöÄ Deployment Recommendations

### Testnet First:
- ‚úÖ Deploy to Avalanche Fuji
- ‚úÖ Test all flows thoroughly
- ‚úÖ Gather user feedback
- ‚úÖ Fix bugs and optimize

### Before Mainnet:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Community building
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Marketing strategy
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend event syncing service
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Multi-sig for contract ownership

---

A: Not recommended without security audit and additional features. This is an MVP/demo.

**Q: How do I get support?**
A: Open an issue on GitHub or join the Discord community.
