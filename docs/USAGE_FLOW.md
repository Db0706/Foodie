## Next Steps

After successful deployment and testing:
1. Get testnet AVAX from faucet
2. Deploy contracts to Fuji
3. Update `.env.local` with contract addresses
4. Set up Firebase/Supabase project
5. Configure Pinata for IPFS
6. Test full flow end-to-end
7. Share with community for testing
8. Prepare for mainnet deployment
